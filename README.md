# Nerdit1.0

The purpose of the application is when the user wants to look up online their favorite games as they are either stuck on a specific part of the game, want to see specific pictures to save to their albums, or would just like to see what other people think of the game, they may use our website
The user is able to create a user ID and password on the website in order to create a profile that will show to other users on the application

the user is then able to search their favorite video games and return results will show of fellow user comments explaining areas they may be stuck on or just simple reviews of how the game plays
If the user would like to to look up the specific release date, ratings etc from the video game they are about to purchase or heard about they may do so as well

In future development we plan to add a favoriting feature so poeple can favorite specific comments and screenshots etc to later go back and view
The general idea of the entire project is to create an application for gamers around the world to connect and assist eachother while sharing thoughts on the game as well
